Project with Bo


This project creates an printer that can print out orders from oscommerce (oscommerce.com)


It will pool a php files for a list of pending orders every 30 sec, if any it will print it on a thermal printer and set the status to processing, every 12 hours or so it will set them all to done, there is a free choice to let the customer know or not.

This is just a quick and dirty stage 1. It's made to be fast to use in a pizza delivery.


Stage 2, will add a LCD display and 3 buttons.

When an order comes in it will start a buzzer, user then press ok and order prints and customer are notified that oder is processing.

LCD will show orders under processing.

When done user selects the order with up and down and then selects it with ok, it will ask if complete and a press with ok will tell the customer the order is done and it should be there shortly


a work in progress still, will update as we get along
